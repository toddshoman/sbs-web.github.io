<p class="msg msg--success align-left"><strong>Daryl Bem: A Brief Professional Bio</strong><br>Daryl J. Bem, professor emeritus of psychology at Cornell University, obtained his BA degree in physics from Reed College in 1960, and began graduate work in physics at MIT. The civil rights movement had just begun, and he became so intrigued with the changing attitudes toward desegregation in the American South that he decided to switch fields and pursue a career as a social psychologist specializing in attitudes and public opinion. He obtained his PhD degree in social psychology from the University of Michigan in 1964, and has since taught at Carnegie-Mellon University, Stanford, Harvard, and Cornell University, where he has been since 1978. He retired from Cornell on June 30, 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Roger D. Nelson</strong> was the director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Consciousness_Project" title="Global Consciousness Project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Consciousness Project</a> (GCP), an international, multi-laboratory collaboration founded in 1997 which aimed to study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_consciousness" title="Collective consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collective consciousness</a>. From 1980 to 2002, he was Coordinator of Research at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Engineering_Anomalies_Research" title="Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research</a> (PEAR) laboratory at Princeton University. His professional focus was the study of consciousness and intention and the role of mind in the physical world. His work integrates science and spirituality, including research that is directly focused on numinous communal experiences. </p>
<p>Nelson began using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_event_generator" title="Random event generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">random event generator</a> (REG) technology in the field to study effects of special states of group consciousness. This led to the GCP, a globally distributed network of REGs around the world sending data continuously over the Internet to a server in Princeton, NJ. The network is designed to register indications of a hypothesised global consciousness responding to major world events such as 9/11/2001, the beginnings of war, or New Year's Eve.</p>
